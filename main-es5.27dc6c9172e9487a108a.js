One open source solution uses the OpenCV framework, a real-time computer vision library. This program uses facial landmarks to determine if a car driver is dowsy. It calculates a threshold for which the driver\'s eyes are closed for a sufficiently long time, responding with an audible alarm to alert the driver. One automobile company has a drowsiness detection solution that utilizes an infrared camera above the steering wheel, detecting more complex signs of tiredness such as frequent blinking, deviations in steering, and distracted head movements.

When encrypting a message, the encryption method chooses two random values between 0 and 100. These values are used to decide which Diffie-Hellman keys from firebase to use for encryption. When encrypting or decrypting, if the client does not have a locally stored cache of the keys it needs, either public or private used to encrypt or decrypt, the client will pause the decryption or encryption method until it can retrieve those keys from firebase and complete the encryption.
