    "summary": "Growing up I was always looking for new things to take apart and put back together. Building, Creating and learning have been passions of mine since long before I knew I wanted to be a computer engineer. I have always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my goals have taken many twists and turns — from interests in electrical engineering to robotics, machine learning and even security/cryptography — I have never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.\n\nAs a full stack web developer, I enjoy using my strong attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my passion for problem solving to take on any challenge that comes my way. That's why I am excited to make a big impact wherever I work.",
