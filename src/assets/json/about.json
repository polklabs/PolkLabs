Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from touring and recording artist, to employee of the year at a non-profit, to dean's scholar at UPenn, to small business owner and entrepreneur — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.\n\nAs a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.\nAnd this summary isn't totally stolen and being used as a placeholder.",
