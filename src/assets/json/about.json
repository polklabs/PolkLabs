    "summary": "Growing up I was always looking for new things to take apart and put back together. Building, Creating and learning have been passions of mine since long before I knew I wanted to be a computer engineer. I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my educational goals have taken many twists and turns — from wanting to be an electrical engineer to robotics, machine learning and even working with image processing — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.\n\nAs a full stack web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact wherever I end up.",
