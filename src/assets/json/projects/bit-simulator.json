When a component's output value has changed it sends an update to the breadboard, the breadbaord then updates the pin's value (High, Low, Unknown). It then propagates this update to all connected pins, in the same row and through wires. If a pin value is changed (High to Low, Low to High), the breadboard will then queue up all connected components to be updated. Each frame the breadboard goes through this queue calling the update function on each component which in turn may trigger this whole process again."
